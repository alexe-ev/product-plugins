# 🧠 AI Product Plugins

[![Skills](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills-121-blue)]() [![Domains](https://img.shields.io/badge/domains-15-green)]() [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)](#license)

Your AI agent can write code, summarize documents, and answer questions. But ask it to size an experiment, diagnose a metric drop, or build a launch plan — and it wings it. Generic answers, hallucinated numbers, skipped steps.

**This library fixes that.**

121 structured skills across 15 product domains. Each skill is a playbook that tells the agent exactly what to ask, how to reason through the problem, and what the output should look like. No prompt engineering on your side — just install a domain and go.

Think of it as **product management muscle memory for your AI agent.** The same frameworks, the same rigor, the same questions a great PM would ask — packaged as reusable skills.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Claude Cowork

1. Open **Customize** (bottom-left)
2. Go to **Browse plugins** → **Personal** → **+**
3. Select **Add marketplace from GitHub**
4. Enter: `alexe-ev/product-plugins`

All 15 plugins install automatically, providing both commands and skills.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add alexe-ev/product-plugins

# Step 2: Install individual plugins
/plugin install experimentation@product-plugins
/plugin install data-analytics@product-plugins
/plugin install product-strategy@product-plugins
/plugin install product-discovery@product-plugins
/plugin install product-planning@product-plugins
/plugin install gtm@product-plugins
/plugin install marketing-growth@product-plugins
/plugin install ai-product@product-plugins
/plugin install business-commercial@product-plugins
/plugin install customer-success@product-plugins
/plugin install product-ops@product-plugins

/plugin install technical-product@product-plugins
/plugin install risk-compliance@product-plugins
/plugin install ux-research@product-plugins
```

### Other AI Assistants (Skills Only)

The `skills/*/SKILL.md` files follow the universal skill format. Copy skill folders to the appropriate tool directory:

| Tool | Directory | Command |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills/` | `for plugin in */; do cp -r "$plugin/skills/"* ~/.gemini/skills/ 2>/dev/null; done` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` | `for plugin in */; do mkdir -p .opencode/skills/; cp -r "$plugin/skills/"* .opencode/skills/ 2>/dev/null; done` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | Copy skill folders manually |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/skills/` | Copy skill folders manually |
| Kiro | `.kiro/skills/` | Copy skill folders manually |

### Use a skill

```
/experimentation:estimate-sample-size
```

The skill walks Claude through the right questions, methodology, and output format. If required inputs are missing, it stops and asks — no hallucinated numbers, no guesswork.

## 💡 What this looks like in practice

Running an A/B test and need to know if you have enough traffic:
```
/experimentation:estimate-sample-size
```

Metric dropped 12% last week and nobody knows why:
```
/data-analytics:diagnose-metric-movement
```

Investor deck needs a real business case, not vibes:
```
/business-commercial:build-business-case
```

Stakeholders are misaligned on the roadmap, again:
```
/product-planning:build-roadmap-prioritization
```

No googling, no guessing, no "let me think about that." Each skill walks Claude through the right questions, the right methodology, and the right output format — every time.

## 🏆 Does it actually work?

All 121 skills were evaluated across 3 independent rounds. Each round used different test cases and evaluation criteria written by a different LLM without access to skill instructions. Claude evaluated responses in all rounds — which matches real-world usage but means results carry some self-evaluation bias.

**Overall results across 3 rounds (poor-context inputs):**

| | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Avg |
|--|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| Avg WITH skill | 95% | 94% | 99% | **96%** |
| Avg WITHOUT skill | 84% | 54% | 37% | **58%** |
| Avg delta | +11 pp | +40 pp | +62 pp | **+38 pp** |

The spread across rounds reflects how strictly each LLM wrote the criteria. The average delta of **+38 pp** is the most reliable single number.

**Where skills add the most value:**

Skills that enforce structured output, block on missing inputs, or guard against specific failure modes consistently outperform vanilla Claude. Strongest results in `risk-compliance`, `gtm` (launch plans, battlecards), `data-analytics`, and `product-ops`.

**Where skills add less:**

Domains where Claude's training already covers the framework well — `experimentation` hypothesis formulation, general `product-strategy` — show smaller gains. Vanilla Claude handles these reasonably without additional guidance.

**What skills prevent in practice:**

- **Hallucinated specifics.** Without a skill, the model invents numbers, thresholds, and recommendations on vague inputs. Skills stop and ask instead.
- **Skipped prerequisites.** Without a skill, the model proceeds with incomplete inputs. Skills surface what's missing before producing output.
- **Wrong output format.** Without a skill, responses are conversational. Skills enforce the structure a PM can actually hand off.


---

## 🏗️ Skill structure

Every skill is a standalone playbook:

```
experimentation/skills/estimate-sample-size/
├── SKILL.md        ← what to ask, how to reason, what to output
├── REFERENCE.md    ← formulas and methodology (calculation skills)
└── examples/       ← how the skill behaves with complete vs. incomplete inputs
```

Skills don't hallucinate methodology. If required inputs are missing, they stop and ask. If the math is uncertain, they say so.

## 🙌 Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Whether it's improving an existing skill, adding a new one, or benchmarking another domain — open a PR or issue.

When adding or editing a skill:

1. Follow the existing structure: `SKILL.md` + optional `REFERENCE.md` + `examples/`
2. Include at least one example with complete inputs and one with missing inputs
3. Skills should ask for missing information, not hallucinate it
4. Keep the scope tight — one skill, one job
